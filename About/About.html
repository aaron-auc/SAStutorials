<em>Illustration of some of the main ideas behind SAStutorials.org</em></a>
</p>

<h4>Idea and inspiration</h4>
<p>
SAStutorials.org was initiated in 2023 by Andreas Haahr Larsen, Jacob Kirkensgaard and Martin Cramer Pedersen. The basic idea came from the observation that small-angle scattering (SAS) is difficult to interpret for students and new users alike. There are many pitfalls in the analysis and interpretation of SAS data. <br>
Motivated by this, we wanted to create an effective learning platform that could be used in courses and as self-study. This led to SAStutorial.org, first as a tool used in our own courses at University of Copenhagen, but later expanded to (hopefully) be a community learning tool. <br>
The site is motivated by a similar tool in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, <a href="http://www.mdtutorials.com/" target="_blank">www.mdtutorials.com</a> (by Justin Lemkul), which is a widely used resource for learning MD simulation. <br>
</p>

<h4>Tutorial design and didactic principles</h4>
<p>
The core design ideas and pedagogical principles have been described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576725001062" target="_blank">our 2025 paper published in Journal of Applied Crystallography</a>.

<h4>Presentation video</h4>
<p>
SAStutorials.org was presented at the <a href="https://www.sas2024.tw/" target="_blank">SAS2024 conference</a>, and a (post) recorded version is available <a href="https://youtu.be/KewW9GyUWak" target="_blank">here</a>. 
</p>

<h4>Core principles</h4>
SAStutorials.org rely on four core principles
<ol>
	<li><em>Activity</em>. We believe learning comes from hands-on activities, whether through working with different data analysis strategies, or derivations of form factors. Learning comes from what the learner does, not from what the teacher does (or says).</li>
	<li><em>Accessibility</em>. We hope to make learning of small-angle scattering accessible to all users. All information and software should be accessible for all, and require as little effort as possible. We support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science" target="_blank">Open Science</a>.</li>
	<li><em>Transferability</em>. The achieved skills should be transferable to actual data, such that the aquired skills can be applied to real science, not only "text-book problems".</li>
	<li><em>Inclusivity</em>. We encourage active participation and contribution from experts in the field, to cover a broad range of sample types, experiemental techniques and analysis strategies/programs within the small-angle scattering "umbrella". Also, we encourage discussion and contributions from users of the tutorials.</li>
</ol>
