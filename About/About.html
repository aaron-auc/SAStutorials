<h1>About SAStutorials.org</h1>

<em>Illustration of some of the main ideas behind SAStutorials.org</em></a>
</p>

<h4>Idea</h4>
<p>
SAStutorials.org was initiated in 2023 by Andreas Haahr Larsen, Jacob Kirkensgaard and Martin Cramer Pedersen. The basic idea came from the observation that small-angle scattering (SAS) is difficult to interpret for students and new users alike. There are many pitfalls in the analysis and interpretation of SAS data. <br>
Motivated by this, we wanted to create an effective learning platform that could be used in courses and as self-study. This led to SAStutorial.org, first as a tool used in our own courses at University of Copenhagen, but later expanded to (hopefully) be a community learning tool. <br>
The site is motivated by a similar tool in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, <a href="mdtutorial.com" target="_blank">mdtutorials.com</a> (by Justin Lemkul), which is a very popular tool for learning MD simulation. 
</p>

<h4>Core principles</h4>
SAStutorials.org rely on four core principles
<ol>
	<li><em>Activity</em>. We believe learning comes from hands-on activities, whether through working with different data analysis strategies, or derivations of form factors. Learning comes from what the learner does, not from what the teacher does (or says).</li>
	<li><em>Accessibility</em>. We hope to make learning of small-angle scattering accessible to all users. All information and software should be accessible for all, and require as little effort as possible. We support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science" target="_blank">Open Science</a>.</li>
	<li><em>Transferability</em>. The achieved skills should be transferable to actual data, such that the aquired skills can be applied to real science, not only "text-book problems".</li>
	<li><em>Inclusivity</em>. We encourage active participation and contribution from experts in the field, to cover a broad range of sample types, experiemental techniques and analysis strategies/programs within the small-angle scattering "umbrella". Also, we encourage discussion and contributions from users of the tutorials.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tutorial design and didactic principles</h4>
<p>
	Our goal is that all tutorials roughly follow the same design. This design is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_observed_learning_outcome" target="_blank">structure of observed learning outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy</a> as well as the <a href="https://obl.ku.dk/theme/tds-model/" target="_blank">theory of didactic situations (TDS)</a>. <br>
	We are working on a paper describing the website and the didactic philosophy and plan to submit this to the SAS2024 special issue of Journal of Applied Crystallography. <br><br>
