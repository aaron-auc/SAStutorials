<h4>Before you start</h4>
<p>
<ul>
 	<li>It's a good idea to have SASView installed for this tutorial. You can download it from <a href="https://www.sasview.org/", target="_blank">sasview.org</a>. </li>
	<li>You will need to make calculations by hand. A spreadsheet and possibly pen and paper are recommended.</li>	
</ul>
</p>


<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
After completing this tutorial you will
<ul>
	<li>Understand the difference between scattering length densities for X-rays and neutrons.</li>
	<li>Be able to calculate scattering length densities for both X-rays and neutrons.</li>
	<li>Be able to calculate percentages of D$_2$O and H$_2$O to match out certain parts of a sample.</li>
	<li>Decide on SANS/SAXS and solvent based on your specific sample.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Part I: Introduction</h4>
	<p>
		Scattering length density (SLD) is a measure of a material's ability to scatter. SLD varies greatly depending on whether X-rays (SAXS) or neutrons (SANS) are used.
		This is because X-rays scatter from the electrons of a material, while neutrons scatter from the nuclei. In general, the SLD of a material can be calculated as:
		\begin{equation}
			\text{SLD} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{V},
		\end{equation}
		Where $b_i$ is the (bound coherent) scattering length of atom $i$, and $V$ is the molecular volume of the material. For X-rays, the scattering length of an atom is roughly proportional to the atomic number $Z$ of that atom.
		However for neutrons, the scattering lengths of atoms vary irregularly throughout the periodic table. This is illustrated in the figure below.<br><br>

		<img src="SLDXN2.png" style="width:800px"/>
		<br>
		<em>Comparison of coherent scattering lengths for Neutrons (red) and X-rays (Blue).</em>
		<br><br>

		For neutrons, it is common to list the scattering length of an atom in units of fm (femtometers, $10^{-15}$ m). For our applications, the X-ray scattering length
		of an atom is essentially given by $b=Zr_e$, where $r_e = 2.82 \text{ fm}$ is the classical electron radius.
		This approximation holds because SAXS uses hard X-rays ($E>5-10 \text{ keV}$) with wavelengths dissimilar from those often absorbed by atoms in soft matter. <br><br>

			<b>Exercise: Calculate scattering length densities.</b>
			<li>In this exercise we will calculate the scattering length densities for the two most commonly used solvents in SAS experiments, H$_2$O and D$_2$O for both X-rays and neutrons.</li>

		In practice, one should use a SLD Calculator. In Sasview, the SLD Calculator can be found under "Tools". Alternatively one can use <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/activation/", target="_blank">an online calculator from NIST.</a><br><br>

		Most SAS experiments are performed in a solvent, which has a SLD of its own. If the SLD of the sample is similar to the solvent's SLD,
		the scattering from the sample will be weak. We measure this difference as <i>excess scattering length density</i>,

		\begin{equation}
			\Delta \text{SLD} = \text{SLD}_{\text{sample}} - \text{SLD}_{\text{solvent}}.
		\end{equation}

		The intensity of scattering from the sample is proportional to the $\Delta \text{SLD}^2$ which we call <i>contrast</i>. <br><br>

		Sometimes however, we want to match the SLD of the sample to the solvent, to make the sample or a part of the sample <i>invisible</i>.
		This technique is called <i>contrast variation</i>. In the exercise below, you will learn how to match out a protein.<br><br>

			<b>Exercise: Match out a protein in SANS</b>
			<li>Since there is only a difference in SLD between H$_2$O and D$_2$O for neutrons, this exercise only relates to SANS.</li>
			<li>Assume that the SLD of a protein is $1.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ Å}^{-2}$.</li>
			<li>Calculate the percentages of H$_2$O and D$_2$O in your solvent in order to match out the protein ($\Delta \text{SLD}=0$). You can use the numbers you calculated in the previous exercise</li>

				<p id="hiddenText">To do this, you have to isolate x in the following equation
					\begin{equation}
						\Delta \text{SLD} =\text{SLD}_{\text{protein}} - x \times \text{SLD}_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} - (1-x) \times \text{SLD}_{\text{D}_2\text{O}} = 0,
					\end{equation}
					where $x$ is the percentage of H$_2$O in the solvent.

<h4>Part II: Sodium dodecyl sulfate</h4>
	<p>
		This section focuses on the detergent <i>sodium dodecyl sulfate</i> (SDS), CH$_3$(CH)$_2$OSO$_3$Na. SDS is widely used in SAS experiments for its ability to solubilize proteins effectively.
		As a first exercise, calculate the SLD of SDS for both X-rays and neutrons with <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/activation/", target="_blank">the online calculator from NIST.</a>
		For this you only need the molecular formula of SDS and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_dodecyl_sulfate", target="_blank">the density which can be found on wikipedia</a>. 
		For the X-ray source assume an energy of 10 keV. You should see a table like the one below. <br><br>

		<img src="NISTCalculationSDS.png" style="width:800px"/><br><br>

		Under "Scattering length density" is the SLD for neutrons as "real". The SLD for X-rays is given as "X-ray SLD" under "real". Both marked in red.<br><br>

		Next, determine the percentage of H$_2$O and D$_2$O in your solvent in order to match out SDS in a SANS experiment.
		(The answer to this question is given below the table as the "Contrast match point")<br><br>

		In reality, the SLD of SDS varies between the head group and the tail group. In addition to this, SDS forms micelles in solution with 
		aggregation number $N=66$. In the exercise below, we calculate the forward scattering ($I(q=0)$) of SDS micelles, which is given by

		\begin{equation}
			I(q=0) = n N^2 \left( \Delta SLD_{tail} V_{tail} +  \Delta SLD_{head} V_{head}\right)^2,
		\end{equation}

		where $n$ is the number density of the micelles.

			<b>Exercise: SDS head and tail group</b>
			<li>In the image below the head/tail structure of the SDS molecule can be seen,
				as well as some SAXS data with a SDS concentration of 5 mg/mL. </li>
			<li>Calculate the SLD for the headgroup (SO$_4$Na, $V=60.5 \text{ Å}^3$), and tailgroup (C$_{12}$H$_{25}$, $V=355 \text{ Å}^3$) for X-rays.</li>
			<li>Calculate the number density $n$ of micelles. (Start by calculating the concentration in $\text{mol/cm}^3$).</li>
			<li>Finally, calculate the forward scattering</li>
			<li>How does it compare to the data in the graph?</li>

	In some applications, it can be useful to <i>deuterate</i> the detergents. This is done by replacing the hydrogen in the detergent with deuterium.

<h4>Part III: Designing a neutron scattering experiment</h4>
<p>
	In this part, we will design a SANS experiment to study the size and polydispersity of SiO$_2$ nanoparticles.
	Additionally, a cationic surfactant (CetylTrimethylAmmonium Bromide - CTAB) is added to the solution in a concentration 
	close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_micelle_concentration" target="_blank">critical micelle concentration</a> (CMC). The added CTAB is expected to form micelles around the nanoparticles with a thickness 2-3 nm.
	The added CTAB prohibits aggregation of SiO$_2$ nanoparticles.
	For our experiment we wish to gain information on both the SiO$_2$ nanoparticles and the CTAB coating. First we would like to find all 
	the relevant SLDs.<br>

	<ul style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid;border-color:#697698; padding: 1em; padding-left: 40px; background-color: #f9f9f9"> 
		<b>Task 1: Find SLDs</b>

	Next we want to calculate the $\Delta \text{SLD}$ between all the different substances. For better comparison, we will put $\Delta \text{SLD}^2$ in the table.
	Additionally, the values above the diagonal should be the (square!) neutron contrast, while the values below the diagonal should be the (square!) X-ray contrast.<br><br>

		<li>Which features will you expect to see with X-rays?</li>
		<li>If you use normal/heavy water as your solvent, which features can you expect to see with neutrons?</li>
	</ul>


	Before we make a decision on what kind of experiment(s?) to perform, we should also consider incoherent scattering.
	Incoherent scattering contributes $|Q|$-independent background to the scattering. This makes it difficult to see
	features in the data, especially at low $Q$-values, where the signal is weaker. However, this is essentially only a problem for neutrons.
	Go back to the SLD calculator, and find the incoherent scattering cross section for H$_2$O and D$_2$O for neutrons. <br><br>

				<li>X-ray scattering with water as solvent. From the table in task 2, we see that the $\Delta \text{SLD}^2$ for silica is much higher than that of CTAB.
