<h4>Before you start</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>We assume basic understanding of scattering length density and contrast in small-angle scattering</li>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
	Be able to design a contrast-variation experiments in SANS for structure determination. Specifically, you will be able to: 
	<ul> 
		<li>Explain the relationship between contrast and signal-over-noise in SANS data.</li>
		<li>Tune contrasts of a particle such that the forward scattering is zero.</li>	
		<li>Calculate scattering lenghts, scattering length densities and contrasts for a molecule, and use this to design a contrast-match experiment.</li>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Part 1: Monodisperse spheres with various contrasts</h4>
	<p>
	Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/" target="_blank">Shape2SAS</a> and simulate a spheres with a radius of 50 Å and contrast (excess scattering length density, $\Delta\mathrm{SLD}$) of 1 as Model 1, and a sphere with contrast $\Delta\mathrm{SLD}-1$ as Model 2 (set parameters and press Submit):<br>
	<img src="Shape2SAS_input.png" style="width:800px"/><br>
	Why is the scattering the same despite that the $\Delta\mathrm{SLD}$ have opposite sign? (<a href="hint0.html" target="_blank">Hint</a>)<br>
	Try to vary the contrast. How does a numerically larger $\Delta\mathrm{SLD}$ affect the simulated scattering, and why? (<a href="hint0.html" target="_blank">Hint</a>)<br>
	<em>Take-home message</em>: higher contrast gives a larger signal-over-noise, and is therefore preferable.
	</p>

<h4>Part II: Core-shell spheres</h4>
	<p>
	Go to: <a href="https://somo.chem.utk.edu/shape2sas/" target="_blank">Shape2SAS</a>, and simulate a spherical core-shell particle with inner radius of 30 Å and core $\Delta\mathrm{SLD}=-1$, and outer radius of 50 Å and shell $\Delta\mathrm{SLD}=1$. This can be done by combining two spheres as Model 1 
	<p style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid;border-color:#697698; padding: 1em; padding-left: 40px"> <b> Note on order of subunites in Shape2SAS </b><br>
		Overlapping points from different subunits are removed (by default). <br>
		The points from the subunits that are lowest in the list are removed, whereas points from subunits higher in the list remain. <br>
		So in the case of a cores-shell particle, the smaller sphere should be above the larger in the subunit list, so the overlapping points are excluded from the larger sphere.
	</p>
	<img src="Shape2SAS_CoreShell.png" style="width:800px"/><br>
	What combination of radii of the core-shell (Model 1) would yield $I(0)$ of 0? (<a href="hint11.html" target="_blank">Hint</a>). Try to simulate this. Due to the stochastic nature of Shape2SAS, $I(0)$ may not be exactly 0, but will be small.<br>	
	<br>

<h4>Part III: Match-out DDM in 100% D<sub>2</sub>O</h4>
	The goal of this subpart is to calculate how much to deuterate a <a href="https://avantilipids.com/product/850520" target="_blank">DDM detergent</a> in order to match it out in a SANS experiment at 100% D<sub>2</sub>O. This can be done by following these steps:
	<ol> 
		<li> Use the chemical formulas to calculate the neutron coherent scattering lenghts for heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O), DDM headgroups (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>21</sub>O<sub>11</sub>) and DDM tailgroups (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>25</sub>), using <a href="https://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/" target="_blank">NIST tabular values</a> (<a href="step-by-step-d2o.html" target="_blank">step-by-step guide for calculating SL for D<sub>2</sub>O</a>).</li>
		<li> Use experimentally determined molecular volumes to calculate scattering lenghts densities $\mathrm{SLD}=SL/V$ and <em>contrasts</em> $\Delta\mathrm{SLD} = \mathrm{SLD}-\mathrm{SLD}_\mathrm{D2O}$ for heavy water (30.0 Å<sup>3</sup>), DDM headgroups (350.4 Å<sup>3</sup>) and DDM tailgroup (350.2 Å<sup>3</sup>).</li> 
		<li> Put the results into a <a href="table_start.xlsx" target="_blank"> spreadsheet</a>:<br>
		<img src="table_start.png" style="width:1200px"/><br>
		<li> Take <em>exchangable hydrogens</em> in account, i.e., hydrogens that are not strongly bound, and become deuterium when DDM is submerged in D<sub>2</sub>O.<br>
		There are 7 exchangable Hs in the the DDM headgroup, but none in the tailgroup, as these hydrogens are tightly bound to the carbons. <br>
	    Calculate the $\mathrm{SLD}$ and $\Delta\mathrm{SLD}$ of the DDM headgroup after exchange (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>14</sub>D<sub>7</sub>O<sub>11</sub>), where H denote non-exchangable hydrogen, and D denote hydrogen that have been exchanged with Ds from the solvent ("DDM head in D2O" in the spreadsheet above).<br>
		<li>Now, calculate how many of the non-exchangable Hs that should be deuterated in the DDM head to match out these components, i.e. get zero contrast when solvated in D<sub>2</sub>O ($\Delta\mathrm{SLD}=0$). For the head groups:
		$$SLD_\mathrm{head} = SLD_\mathrm{D2O}$$
		$$SL_\mathrm{head} = SL_\mathrm{D2O}\frac{V_\mathrm{head}}{V_\mathrm{D2O}}$$
		where $SL_\mathrm{head}=12SL_C+(14-n)SL_H+(7+n)SL_D+11SL_O$ and $n_\mathrm{head}$ is the average number of non-exchangable H's that should be deuterated:
		$$n_\mathrm{head} = (SL_\mathrm{D2O}\frac{V_\mathrm{head}}{V_\mathrm{D2O}}-12SL_C-14SL_H-7SL_D-11SL_O)/(SL_D-SL_H)$$
		</li>
		<li>Repeat this for the DDM tail groups.</li>
		<!-- You can use the average values - no need to reach an integer number. It is ok to do this experimentally as each measurement is a measure of many particles.<br> -->
	</ol>
	Once you are done, you may check with <a href="table_filled.xlsx" target="_blank"> this filled-out spreadsheet</a> (but try calculating everything before you look at the answer).
	<p style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid;border-color:#697698; padding: 1em; padding-left: 40px"><b>Incoherent scattering in SANS</b><br>
		Incoherent scattering contribute a constant scattering signal (i.e. the same in all directions). Therefore, it carries no structural information.<br>
		Therfore, it is generally better to measure samples in D<sub>2</sub>O rather than in H<sub>2</sub>O in SANS, due to <a href="https://e-learning.pan-training.eu/wiki/index.php/Basics_of_neutron_scattering#Coherent_and_incoherent_scattering" target="_blank">incoherent scattering</a> from hydrogen, which result in a poor signal-to-noise ratio.<br>
		If you want numerical values, you may follow the (<a href="step-by-step-d2o.html" target="_blank">step-by-step guide for calculating SL for D<sub>2</sub>O</a>), but use the inhoherent scattering lengths (Inc b) insted of the coherent scattering lengths (Coh b). Then you can calculate the total incoherent scatteirng lenght from the various components. 
	</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Challenge 1: You are interested in the structure of a polymer chain, inside a polymer melt. I.e. a melt consisting of a lot of the same polymer chains. However, when measuring, you just get a flat (constant) signal. How do you approach the problem? Hint: contrast variation may help.</li>
		<li>Challenge 2: You would like to contrast-match the phospholipid <a href="https://avantilipids.com/product/850335" target="_blank">DLPC</a> in D<sub>2</sub>O, in order to measure membrane proteins in an invisible lipid bilayer with SANS. Headgroup phospotidylcholine (PC) has the chemical formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>18</sub>NO<sub>8</sub>P (6 of these hydrogens are exchangable) and volume a of 319 Å<sup>3</sup>. The tail group dilauroyl (DL) has the chemical formula C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>46</sub> (no exchangable hydrogens) and a volume of 666 Å<sup>3</sup>. How many of the (non-exghangeable) hydrogens should be deuterated in, respectively, head and tail to match-out DLPC in a solvent of 100% D<sub>2</sub>O?</li>
	</ol>
