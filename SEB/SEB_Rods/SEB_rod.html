<h4>Before you start</h4>

	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/Tobionecenobi/SEB">Download and install Scattering Equation Builder (SEB)</a></li>
	<li>Complete the <a href="../SEB_Polymers/SEB_polymer.html">polymer tutorial</a> to understand how SEB works and how scattering from a Gaussian polymer model is derived.</li>	
	</ul>

<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
In this tutorial you will learn about the scattering from dilute isotropic solutions of rods, in particular
<ul>
	<li>how to calculate the form factor of a rod,</li>
	<li>and how the scattering from a stiff rod differs from a random walk polymer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rods</h4>

	<p>
	A rod is a simple geometric model of stiff molecules such as actin and microtubuli. 
	Later we will also be using it as a building block in SEB to make more complicated structures.
	</p>

<h4>Derivation of the scattering from a rod</h4>
		
        <p>
          We think of a single straight thin rod of length $b$ in a solution, where each point on the rod is a point scatterer, then the form factor can be stated as
	</p>

	<p>$$F(q) = \left<\frac{\sin(q r)}{qr} \right>_P, $$</p>

        <p>which is known as the Debye Formula. Since the rod can be oriented in any direction, the form factor only depends on the magnitute of the momentum transfer $q$, and the scattering pattern will be axis symmetric around the direct beam.</p>

        <p>

</p>

        <p>The rod is straight, hence the probability $P$ denotes the probability of two random scatterers on a straight line being a distance $r$ apart. We randomly pick one scatterer from an uniform distribution in the interval $[0,b]$. Thus $P(x_1)=1/b$ for $x_1\in [0,b]$ and zero elsewhere. This corresponds to the integral $ \int_0^b \frac{dx_1}{b} \cdots$. We pick the second scatterer $x_2$ from the same distribution, and with these two scatterers the distance between them is $r=|x_1-x_2|$, because the rod is straight. Thus the average corresponds to performing the following integrals:</p>

   <p>$$ F(q) = \int_0^b \frac{dx_1}{b} \int_0^b \frac{dx_2}{b} \frac{\sin(q |x_1-x_2|)}{q|x_1-x_2|},$$</p>
   
   <p>unfortunately the result of these integrals can not be expressed as a combination of the usual functions we know. The result is $$F(q)=\frac{2(\cos(x)-1+x Si(x))}{x^2}$$ where $x=qb$ and $Si(x)=\int_0^x dt sin(t)/t$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_integral">sin integral function</a>. This function has to be evaluated numerically and SEB can do this. </p>


<h4>Scattering Equation Builder (SEB)</h4>

	<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576724001729">Scattering Equation Builder</a> (SEB) is a C++ library for analytical derivation of form factors of complex structures. The structures are build out of basic building blocks called sub-units. Polymers and rods are two of the sub-units supported by SEB.</p>
	
	<p>Before you can use SEB you need to install a working C++ compiler, the GiNaC, GSL, and CLN libraries, and the SEB source code itself. See <a href="https://github.com/Tobionecenobi/SEB">GitHub</a> for the details of how to install SEB on various operating system. Important you need to remember the folder, where you put the SEB source code. It has a subfolder "work" where you can save and compile your own programs.
	</p>

	
<h4>Rods with SEB</h4>	
	
	<p>To calculate the form factor of a rod, cut'n'paste the following C++ program into an text editor (e.g. notepad). Save it as "Rod.cpp" in the work folder under the SEB installation.</p>
	
		<ol style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid;border-color:#697698; padding: 1em; padding-left: 40px" >
<pre><div id="code">
// Include SEB functionality
#include "SEB.hpp"

int main()
{
    // Create world of sub-units
    World w("World");

    // Add a single rod-subunit named "A"
    GraphID r = w.Add(new <b>ThinRod</b>(), "A");

    // Wrap unit in a structure named Structure (this will make sense later)
    w.Add(r, "Structure");
    
    // Print out equation for the form factor
    ex F=w.FormFactor("Structure");
    cout << "Form Factor= " << F << "\n"; 
    
    // To evaluate the equation, we need to define value of paramters
    ParameterList params;
    w.setParameter(params,"<b>L_A</b>",<b>XXX</b>);     // Lengths of the "A" rod
    w.setParameter(params,"beta_A",1);    // Scattering length
    
    // Choose q values
    DoubleVector qvec=w.logspace(0.01, 10.0, 1000 );

    // Use Evaluate to save form factor data to a file
    w.Evaluate( F, params, qvec, "formfactor_rod.q", "Form factor of a rod with beta=1 and L=1.");   
}
</pre>

<h4>Exercise 1 compare the form factor of a rod and a polymer</h4>

	<p>
	In <a href="../SEB_Polymers/SEB_polymer.html#exercise2">exercise 2</a> of the Gaussian Polymer you generated a file "formfactor_polymer.q" with the form factor of a polymer. For large $q$-values we observed $F(q)\sim q^{-2}$ where $2$ happens to be the fractal dimension of a random walk. <br>
	 <ul>	   
	   <li>1a: The code above calculates the form factor of a rod. Bold face indicates the important changes made wrt. the <a href="../SEB_Polymers/SEB_polymer.html#code">polymer code</a>. The radius of gyration of a rod is $R_g^2=b^2/12$, where $b$ is the length of the rod. Change the length of the rod indicated by $XXX$, such that the radius of gyration of the rod matches that of the polymer. <a href="../SEB_Polymers/SEB_polymer.html#run">Run the code as you did in the Polymer example</a></li>

	   <li>1b: 
	   Sketch what you expect a log-log plot of the form factors of a rod and a polymer looks like for small and large $q$ values. (Hint: A rod has fractal dimension $1$.) Then make the plot of the files produced by SEB to see whether they agree with your sketch.</li>

	 </ul>
